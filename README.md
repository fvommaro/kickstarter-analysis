# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows project creators to add incentives for different pledge amounts. In this project we are helping Louise to analyze campaigns historically, so she can launch a campaign successfully. 

For this this project we analyzed how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. So we created charts showing campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals so Louise can learn the best time to launch her campaign and how much money should she set as a goal.



## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The best months to launch a campaign are May and June, as they have a better successful rate, followed by April and July. 

We can also observe that from May to August there were roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched, although in May, the total number of launched projects is higher than any other month.

So we can conclude that the month that most people launch theater campaigns is June, and most of them succeed.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Half of the plays have a goal between $ 1,000.00 and $ 4,999.00. On top of that, the most successful plays are the ones that had goals below $ 5,000.00. 

When we look the chart, we can see that plays that had goals between $ 35,000.00 and $ 45,000.00 were successful overall, but when we look in the data we see that the samples were not large enough to provide confidence in the percentage we observe.



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


My biggest challenge was to write the analysis. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best months to launch a campaign are May and June.
2. The month that most people launch theater campaigns are in June.
3. From May to August there were roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Half of the plays have a goal between $1000 and $4999. 
2. The most successful plays are the ones that had goals below $ 5,000.00. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Don't say the reason the plays were failed or canceled.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Relation between the length of the campaign and their outcome (launched date and Deadline vs Outcome).
2. Backers vs Percentage Funded so we can see if there is a relation between number of backers and success rate.
3. Average Donation vs Percentage Funded so we can see if there is a relation between the average donation and success rate.
4. Year vs Outcomes - to see if in a specific year there were more campaigns been canceled or failed.
